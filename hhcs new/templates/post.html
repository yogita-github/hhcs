                <p>The importance of maintaining good health can't be stressed enough. A healthy body sets the stage for your day-to-day well-being and determines how well you'll age. It also allows you to live an active and more full life, which means you'll have a better quality of life as you age.
                A healthy body requires a mix of a balanced diet, regular exercise, quality sleep, mindfulness and, of course, a healthy lifestyle.</p>
