        <p>
            "Commoners health" is an online health center to predict patients 
            health based on  Age,Gender and body vitals (SBP,HBP,Heart_rate,
            Glucose,SpO2,Temperature) provided by the users of the portal.All the 
            people can access the website free of cost anywhere and everywhere.
            Since health has always been prime necessity it is essential to
            keep a check on it regularly. Health is a state of complete physical,
            mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.
            Health is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources, as well 
            as physical capacities.It is not possible for all the patients to visit doctors
            in remote areas where transport facilities aren't available. We therefore developed 
            an online website for patients without visiting doctors .</p>
